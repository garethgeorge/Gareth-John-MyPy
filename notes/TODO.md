 - correctly read constant pool (add more type information to aid in decoding)
 - create all the different value types we need.
    - investigate using boost::variant for everything maybe
    - list of types
        - string
        - literal (numbers)
        - code
        - object

# TODO
 - implement MAKE_CLOSURE - John/Jack
 - implement Objects/Classes - John/Jack
    - @classmethod &&  @staticmethod???
    - What is the correct way to handle __name__ and other default attrs in PyClass and PyObject?
    - make initialize_from_pyfunc just a constructor
    - Can you define a class inside a function?
    - dont forget calling __init__
    - Does python support mulitple constructors? How do I deal with those
    - Inheritance
    - PyClasses are callable but not PyObjects, test that (unless __call__ is defined in the class?)
    - Classes can overload operators as well as inplace operators differently
    - Make test!
        - Both correct functioning and errors
        - make sure member functions with default args work
 - implement variadic functions - John Jack
 - finish implement continue/break/try/except - John/Jack
 - kwarg functions - John/Jack
 - find a testing framework that specifically tests python interpreters - John/Jack or Garth
 - implement garbage collection - Gareth
 - implement generators/iterators - Gareth
 - primitive types for Lists/Tupples/Map/Set - Gareth
 - implement a ton of builtins for the rest of the quarter
    - print 
    - range
