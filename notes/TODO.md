 - correctly read constant pool (add more type information to aid in decoding)
 - create all the different value types we need.
    - investigate using boost::variant for everything maybe
    - list of types
        - string
        - literal (numbers)
        - code
        - object

# TODO
 - implement MAKE_CLOSURE - John/Jack
 - implement Objects/Classes - John/Jack
    - Inheritance and Multiple Inheritence
    - PyClasses are callable but not PyObjects, test that (unless __call__ is defined in the class?)
    - Classes can overload operators as well as inplace operators differently
    - What is the correct way to handle __name__ and other default attrs in PyClass and PyObject?
    - make initialize_from_pyfunc just a constructor
    - Can you define a class inside a function?
    - Does python support mulitple constructors? How do I deal with those
    - make the 'str' builtin work correctly for PyFuncs, PyObjects, and PyClasses
    - Make tests!
        - Both correct functioning and errors
        - make sure member functions with default args work
        - test everything in classes_test.py for sure
        - test @classmethod &&  @staticmethod!!!!!
        - TypeError: __init__() should return None, not 'int' is a runtime error!
 - implement variadic functions - John Jack
 - finish implement continue/break/try/except - John/Jack
 - kwarg functions - John/Jack
 - find a testing framework that specifically tests python interpreters - John/Jack or Garth
 - implement garbage collection - Gareth
 - implement generators/iterators - Gareth
 - primitive types for Lists/Tupples/Map/Set - Gareth
 - implement a ton of builtins for the rest of the quarter
    - print 
    - range
