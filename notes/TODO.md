 - correctly read constant pool (add more type information to aid in decoding)
 - create all the different value types we need.
    - investigate using boost::variant for everything maybe
    - list of types
        - string
        - literal (numbers)
        - code
        - object

# TODO
 - implement MAKE_CLOSURE - John/Jack
 - implement Objects/Classes - John/Jack
    - Make classes able to overload binary operators
    - Make classes able to overload inplace operators
    - Allow __call__ to be defined
    - PyClasses are callable but not PyObjects unless __call__ is defined
    - make the parents attribute of a pyclass just __mro__! ???
    - super() builtin class (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super)
        - In order to implement super, I need to make it a builtin PyClass (PyObject?) with __call__ defined
    - __mro__ attribute. (I also need to get all attributes right!)
    - __bases__ attribute
    - DYNAMIC INHERITANCE???
    - Use GC
    - What is the correct way to handle __name__ and other default attrs in PyClass and PyObject?
    - make initialize_from_pyfunc just a constructor
    - Can you define a class inside a function?
    - make the 'str' builtin work correctly for PyFuncs, PyObjects, and PyClasses
    - Speed up searching parent attributes and way improve the code for determining method resolution order
    - Builtin class 'object'
    - Make tests!
        - Both correct functioning and errors
        - make sure member functions with default args work
        - test everything in classes_test.py for sure
        - test @classmethod &&  @staticmethod!!!!!
        - TypeError: __init__() should return None, not 'int' is a runtime error!
        - PyClasses are callable but not PyObjects, test that (unless __call__ is defined in the class?)
        - overloading in classes and general function overloading
        - Make sure the 'deadly diamond problem' (https://www.python-course.eu/python3_multiple_inheritance.php) resolves correctly
        - Make sure to test for the error where MRO could not be determined
        - Make tests for MRO consistent with complicated examples lower down in https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/
 - implement variadic functions - John Jack
 - finish implement continue/break/try/except - John/Jack
 - kwarg functions - John/Jack
 - find a testing framework that specifically tests python interpreters - John/Jack or Garth
 - Create a formatted error handling function - Gareth
 - implement garbage collection - Gareth
 - implement generators/iterators - Gareth
 - primitive types for Lists/Tupples/Map/Set - Gareth
 - implement a ton of builtins for the rest of the quarter
    - print 
    - range
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html (these are the python builtin functions)
- POSSIBLE THINGS TO DO EVENTUALLY:
    - Accomplish Direct Threading by putting the 'next opcode fetch and jump' into a #define and
      putting it at the end of every opcode handler instead of a huge switch statement
