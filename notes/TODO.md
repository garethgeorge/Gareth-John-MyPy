 - correctly read constant pool (add more type information to aid in decoding)
 - create all the different value types we need.
    - investigate using boost::variant for everything maybe
    - list of types
        - string
        - literal (numbers)
        - code
        - object

# TODO
 - Closures and cells (MAKE_CLOSURE, LOAD_CLOSURE, *DEREF)
 - Unary operators
 - Finish implementing Objects/Classes - John/Jack
    - Get super() working for single inheritance
    - Test super()
    - What other non-builtins can be overloaded?
    - Use GC
    - What is the correct way to handle __name__ and other default attrs in PyClass and PyObject?
        - All builtin attributes: __mro__, __bases__, etc
    - Speed up searching parent attributes and way improve the code for determining method resolution order
    - Builtin class 'object' -> just nothing?
    - What builtins do I wanna make? Any? Or should we move immediately to optimization?
    - test @classmethod &&  @staticmethod!!!!!
    - Test for errors
        - test, for example, calling '+' on a class w/out it overload (but for ALL posible overloads)
        - getting attributes that dont exist
        - TypeError: __init__() should return None, not 'int' is a runtime error!
 - implement variadic functions - John Jack
 - kwarg functions - John/Jack
 - Direct threading!
 - Implement all opertor overloads fro python strings (make string a builting PyClass) - John/Jack or Gareth
 - Implmenet BINARY_MATRIX_MULTIPLY - John/Jack or Gareth
 - Unary arithmetic operations - John/Jack or Gareth
 - Create a formatted error handling function - Gareth
- finish implement continue/break/try/except - Gareth
 - implement garbage collection - Gareth
 - implement generators/iterators - Gareth
 - primitive types for Lists/Tupples/Map/Set - Gareth
 - implement a ton of builtins for the rest of the quarter
    - print 
    - range
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html (these are the python builtin functions)
- POSSIBLE THINGS TO DO EVENTUALLY:
    - Accomplish Direct Threading by putting the 'next opcode fetch and jump' into a #define and
      putting it at the end of every opcode handler instead of a huge switch statement
    - Get import working
